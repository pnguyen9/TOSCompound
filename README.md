A simple software to check compound attacks for the game Tales of Symphonia. 

Only French is supported for now. 

# How it works
- Select the two characters' artes to find a resulting compound arte. 
- Select a character to narrow down artes to the selected character. 

Only artes that result into a compound arte are shown. Characters without such an arte will display an empty list of arte. 

# Coming soon
The GUI will be reworked: artes and compounds will be displayed in a table instead of selectors. There will be only 3 selectors : 
- For the first character. 
- For the second character. 
- For the compound arte (if user wants to filter by compound arte rather than by character).
