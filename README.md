A simple software to check compound attacks for the game Tales of Symphonia. 

Only French is supported for now. 

# How it works
- Select the two characters' artes to find a resulting compound arte. 
- Select a character to narrow down artes to the selected character. 

Only artes that result into a compound arte are shown. Characters without such an arte will display an empty list of arte.
