A simple software to check compound attacks for the game Tales of Symphonia. 

Only French is supported for now. 

# How it works
A table below displays the possible combinations. 

The 5 selectors at the top allow you to filter, by selecting up to 2 characters, up to 2 artes and the resulting compound arte. 

If the table is empty, the selected combinations don't work.
